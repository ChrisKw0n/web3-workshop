# üåê Web3 Workshop: Smart Contract Development & On-Chain Interaction üöÄ

Welcome to the Web3 Workshop! This hands-on session is designed to introduce developers to the exciting world of smart contract development and on-chain interaction using Solidity and blockchain tools. Let‚Äôs dive in! üåä

## Workshop Overview
This workshop will cover:

1. **üìù Introduction to Smart Contracts**: Understanding the basics of Solidity and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) development.
2. **üöÄ Deploying a Smart Contract**: Hands-on deployment of a simple smart contract to a testnet.
3. **üîó Interacting On-Chain**: Executing contract functions via blockchain transactions.
4. **üíª Using a Web3 Frontend**: Connecting a frontend interface to interact with the deployed contract.
5. **üîí Security & Best Practices**: Discussing security considerations and gas optimizations in smart contracts.

## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this workshop, you should have:

- Basic programming experience (JavaScript or Python preferred) üí°
- A [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet installed üîë
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended) üåü
- A testnet faucet account to obtain test ETH üí∞

## Getting Started
### Clone the Workshop Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/web3-workshop.git
cd web3-workshop

```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file and add the following values:
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
INFURA_API_KEY="your-infura-api-key"
```
>‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Never share your private key or store it in public repositories.

## Deploying the Smart Contract
### Compile the Contract
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deploy to Testnet
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```
This will output the deployed contract address.

## Interacting with the Smart Contract
### Running a Script
Modify `scripts/interact.js` with your deployed contract address, then run:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network goerli
```

### Using a Web3 Frontend
Start the frontend interface to interact with the contract:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the UI.

## Additional Resources
- [Ethereum Solidity Docs](https://soliditylang.org/docs/)
- [Hardhat Documentation](https://hardhat.org/docs/)
- [Ethers.js Guide](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)

## Next Steps
- Experiment with modifying the smart contract
- Deploy to a different testnet/mainnet
- Build a full-stack dApp using this foundation

Happy coding! üöÄ
